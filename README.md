The **Automatic Health Monitoring System** is designed to help manage patient records, store diagnosis reports, and retrieve them to avoid repetitive diagnoses. This Java-based system can be useful in rural and sub-urban areas where regular checkups might be a burden.

##Features we can use:
1. **Patient Registration**: Allows users to register new patients with basic details.
2. **Diagnosis Report Storage**: Stores and links diagnosis reports to specific patients.
3. **Retrieve Reports**: Allows retrieval of a patientâ€™s previous diagnosis reports to avoid unnecessary repeat diagnoses.
4. **Schedule Appointments**: Enables users to schedule future appointments for patients.
5. **Send Emergency Alerts**: Sends emergency alerts to patients based on critical health conditions.

## How It Works:
1. **Register Patient**: Add a new patient by entering their name, age, and contact number.
2. **Add Diagnosis Report**: Create and store diagnosis reports linked to a patient's contact number.
3. **View Patient Reports**: Retrieve all diagnosis reports associated with a specific patient.
4. **Schedule Appointments**: Set up future appointments for patients.
5. **Send Emergency Alerts**: Notify patients about critical health situations requiring immediate attention.

Some of the extra features are added such as providing the health tips based on their age.
So,these type of features are added into the Automatic health monitoring system we can advance this with futurre enhancements such as creating a Database and UI for better usage of this Health Monitoring System.
